# Tracking volunteer hours

This project is developed for BEST Hackathon 2023 using different technologies and tools to create rest-api.
Code `is not` clean because we had about 12 hours to design, write, and there was no time to do quality refactoring

## Review

The project has the following technology stack:

- Spring Boot 3.1.0
- Spring Security 6.1.0 to ensure strong application security
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, authorization and identification of users
- Spring Data JPA to work with the database
- Hibernate 
- HTML and CSS to design the look of emails
- Microsoft Azure for project hosting
- Microsoft SQL for data storage
- SMTP for sending emails
- BCrypt for encrypting passwords
